The Short And Sweet Of It...
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SNCTOOLS is a set of MATLAB tools primarily for reading and writing 
classic model netCDF-3 and netCDF-4 files.  It can use up to three 
backends for this:

    1) tmw, the MathWorks native netCDF package
    2) mexnc, the original open source mex-file
    3) netcdf-java from Unidata

For most cases, support for various read/write configurations is 
summarized in the table below.  


       |  netcdf-3   | netcdf-4     | netcdf-4      | netcdf-4 
       | read/write  | classic read | classic write | enhanced read
-------+-------------+--------------+---------------+-----------------
R2011a |   tmw       | tmw          | tmw           | tmw,netcdf-java 
R2010b |   tmw       | tmw          | tmw           | tmw,netcdf-java 
R2010a |   tmw       | netcdf-java  |               | netcdf-java 
R2009b |   tmw       | netcdf-java  |               | netcdf-java 
R2009a |   tmw       | netcdf-java  |               | netcdf-java 
R2008b |   tmw       | netcdf-java  |               | netcdf-java 
R2008a |   mexnc     | netcdf-java  |               | netcdf-java 
R2007b |   mexnc     | netcdf-java  |               | netcdf-java 
R2007a |   mexnc     | netcdf-java  |               | netcdf-java 
R2006b |   mexnc     | netcdf-java  |               | netcdf-java 
R2006a |   mexnc     | netcdf-java  |               | netcdf-java 
R14    |   mexnc     |              |               |   


There are two exceptions to note.  The mexnc backend is only required
for write support on R14 through R2008a.  If you only need to read
netcdf files, the java backend will work without the mexnc backend.
The second exception is on the win64 platform, as there is no mexnc
backend.  That means that SNCTOOLS cannot write netcdf files on
win64 unless you have R2008b or higher.  You can still use the java
backend on win64 to read netcdf files, though.

"Reading" netcdf-4 enhanced files means that you can read atomic
datatypes.  These can be embedded in groups. 

If you have R2011a and have never used SNCTOOLS, you may be interested
to know that R2011a has new high-level netcdf support.  Please check
that out before proceeding with SNCTOOLS.

Please add this directory to your matlab path.  You must also have 
mexnc on your path in order for snctools to work.

SNCTOOLS is not supported at all on version R13 of MATLAB or earlier.


+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
BASIC INSTALLATION AND USAGE

In order to download SNCTOOLS, please refer to the website, 
http://mexcdf.sourceforge.net/

R2010b
    With R2010b, you have native read/write support for netCDF-3 files
    and classic-model netCDF-4 files.  You can also read enhanced model
    netCDF-4 files, but in order to write to such files, you should drop
    down to MATLAB's native netcdf package interface.

    You must also download netcdf-java from Unidata at
    http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/ as this will
    allow you to read OPeNDAP URLs and GRIB files.  See the USE_JAVA
    section below.

    After downloading and unpacking the software, issue the following
    instructions from MATLAB (assuming that your current working
    directory in MATLAB is where you downloaded and unpacked the
    software):

        addpath ([pwd '/mexcdf/mexnc']);
        addpath ([pwd '/mexcdf/snctools']);
        javaaddpath([pwd '/netcdfAll-4.2.jar']);

    You can test out your installation with

        cd mexcdf/snctools/tests 
        test_snctools

R2008b, R2009a, R2009b, R2010a
    With these releases, you have native read/write support
    for netCDF-3 files.  If you wish to have netCDF-4 read
    support, you will need to download netcdf-java from Unidata at
    http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/ as well.  You get
    more than just netCDF-4 read support with this, you also get read
    support for OPeNDAP URLs and GRIB files.  See the USE_JAVA section
    below.

    After downloading and unpacking the software, issue the following
    instructions from MATLAB (assuming that your current working
    directory in MATLAB is where you downloaded and unpacked the
    software):

        addpath ([pwd '/mexcdf/mexnc']);
        addpath ([pwd '/mexcdf/snctools']);
        javaaddpath([pwd '/netcdfAll-4.1.jar']);

    You can test out your installation with

        cd mexcdf/snctools/tests 
        test_snctools

R2006a, R2006b, R2007a, R2007b, R2008a
    MATLAB has no native netCDF support for these releases.  If you only
    need to read netCDF files, you may do so by retrieving netcdf-java
    from Unidata and enabling the java backend as described below.
    
    After downloading and unpacking the software, issue the following
    instructions from MATLAB (assuming that your current working
    directory in MATLAB is where you downloaded and unpacked the

        addpath ([pwd '/mexcdf/mexnc']);
        addpath ([pwd '/mexcdf/snctools']);
        javaaddpath([pwd '/netcdfAll-4.1.jar']);
        setpref('SNCTOOLS','USE_MEXNC',false);

    You can test out your installation with

        cd mexcdf/snctools/tests 
        test_snctools

    If you need to write netcdf files, then you need to go back to
    the sourceforge website and get the mex-file for your release.
    Then set the USE_MEXNC preference to true:

        setpref('SNCTOOLS','USE_MEXNC',true);

R14
    MATLAB has no native netCDF support for R14.  If you only need
    to read netCDF files, you may do so by retrieving netcdf-java
    from Unidata at http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/,
    but you will be restricted to the 2.2.20 release, which is
    rather old (well, so is R14...)  It will not allow you to read
    netCDF-4 files.

    After downloading and unpacking the software, issue the following
    instructions from MATLAB (assuming that your current working
    directory in MATLAB is where you downloaded and unpacked the
    software):

        addpath ([pwd '/mexcdf/mexnc']);
        addpath ([pwd '/mexcdf/snctools']);
        javaaddpath([pwd '/toolsUI-2.2.20.jar']);
        setpref('SNCTOOLS','USE_MEXNC',false);

    You can test out your installation with

        cd mexcdf/snctools/tests 
        test_snctools

    If you need to write netcdf files, then you need to go back to
    the sourceforge website and get the mex-file for your release.
    Then set the USE_MEXNC preference to true:

        setpref('SNCTOOLS','USE_MEXNC',true);

JAVA Versions

    The java backend is useful for reading OPeNDAP URLs, GRIB2 files, 
	and netCDF-4 files (if your version of MATLAB is R2010a or earlier)
    Netcdf-java can be found at http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/ 
	but you should make sure you retrieve the correct version...

    If your version          Then you should download
    of MATLAB is...          netcdf-java version...
        R2010b                      4.2
        R2010a                      4.1
        R2009b                      4.1
        R2009a                      4.1
        R2008b                      4.1
        R2008a                      4.1
        R2007b                      4.1
        R2007a                      4.1
        R2006b                      4.1
        R2006a                      4.1
        R14                         2.2.20

    Add the jar file to your MATLAB path with

        >> javaaddpath ( '/path/to/netcdfAll-4.2.jar' );

    If you need to access password-protected OPeNDAP resources, you will
    need one more addition to your javapath, i.e.

        >> javaaddpath ( '/path/to/snctools/classes' );

SNCTOOLS PREFERENCES

PRESERVE_FVD
    Way back in the old days, when mexnc/mexcdf was the only game
    in town, data was always transposed when reading/writing netCDF
    data thru MATLAB.  The reason for this was seemingly to make the
    data look consistent with the way that the netcdf tools such as
    "ncdump" presented the metadata.  "ncdump" is compiled in C, so
    it is therefore a row-major-order application, whereas MATLAB 
    presents data in column-major order.
    
    Transposing large datasets can be a costly operation, however, and
    it really isn't necessary in all cases.  SNCTOOLS can be told to
    not transpose data by setting the PRESERVE_FVD preference

        >> clear all 
        >> setpref('SNCTOOLS','PRESERVE_FVD',true);

    By default this preference is false.  If you set it to true,
    you may see a big performance boost for large datasets, but you
    might also end up breaking existing code that expected the data
    to be permuted to row-major order, so you need to be careful
    when using this.

    For efficiency purposes, rather than physically retrieve the
    preference every time it is needed, the preference is stored
    internally as a persistent variable.  In order to change this
    preference, you therefore must invoke CLEAR ALL first.

USE_STD_HDF4_SCALING 
    The CF conventions differ from HDF4 in how scale factors are
    to be applied; check their respective references for details.
    By default, HDF4 datasets are scaled according to CF conventions,
    but setting this preference to true forces NC_VARGET to use
    standard HDF4 conventions.  This preference is only useful when
	reading HDF4 data (obviously), it has no effect upon netCDF I/O.

BUG Reports You Should Know About

1)  Experimental GRIB2 Support

     If you have the netcdf-java jar file on your matlab javaclasspath,
     you can try read GRIB2 files as if they were netcdf files.  This is
     a bit experimental, though.  And if your version of MATLAB is R2008a
     or below, you should take a look at Technical Solution 1-2Z4RS7 on
     the Mathworks web site, http://www.mathworks.com.  This describes a
     workaround for dealing with a conflict with the ucarunits.jar file
     that used to ship with MATLAB until R2008b.  As of March 25, 2010,
     the URL for this technical solution was at

     http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-2Z4RS7/?solution=1-2Z4RS7

2)  Segfaults on certain strided read operations.  

    Affects versions R2008a and R2009a.  Please consult this URL.

    http://www.mathworks.com/support/bugreports/522794

3)  Empty Attributes

    MATLAB versions R2008b thru R2009b incorrectly disallowed the creation
    of empty attributes, which are quite clearly legal.  The bug is
    fixed in 2010a, but fixes for 2008b thru 2009b are available.
    Please consult this URL

    http://www.mathworks.com/support/bugreports/609383

4)  Out-of-memory error with negative indices.  Affects R2008b through
    R2010a, but this only affects those who would use mexnc or the native
    netcdf package directly, not snctools users.  Please consult this URL.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Of all the routines in this m-file collection, the most useful (in my
humble opinion) are as follows
    
    1. nc_varget    - reads a netcdf variable
    2. nc_varput    - writes to a netcdf variable
    3. nc_attget    - reads a netcdf attribute
    4. nc_attput    - writes a netcdf attribute
    6. nc_dump      - prints netcdf metadata
