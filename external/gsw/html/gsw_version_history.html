<h1>Gibbs Sea Water (GSW) version history</h1>
<h2>Version 3.03 <font size="3">(8th June, 2013)</font></h2>
<p>Added</p> 
<ul>
<li>isentropic compressibility (kappa) for the 48-term equation of state.</li>
<li>gsw_rho_first derivatves and gsw_rho_first derivatves_CT_exact.</li>
<li>gsw_alpha_on_beta and gsw_alpha_on_beta_CT_exact.</li>
<li>gsw_t_from_pt0</li>
<li>gsw_t_from_entropy</li>
<li>gsw_adiabatic_lapse_rate_from_CT.</li>
<li>gsw_deltaSA_from_rho_t_exact.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remaned gsw_entropy_t_exact to gsw_entropy_from_t, and added ths inverse function (gsw_t_from_entropy)</p>
<p>Renamed gsw_adiabatic_lapse_rate_t_exact to gsw_adiabatic_lapse_rate_from_t</p>


<h2>Version 3.02 <font size="3">(20th November, 2012)</font></h2>
<p>Improved computation efficiency.</p>
<p>Minor bug fixes.</p>

<h2>Version 3.01 <font size="3">(14th November 2011)</font></h2>
<p>Bug fix in gsw_SA_Sstar_from_SP (line 182).</p>


<h2>Version 3.0 <font size="3">(15th May 2011)</font></h2>
<p>Consists of approximately 166 functions.</p>
<p>Major improvements</p>
<ul>
<li> 48-term density equation introduced (intended for use by observational, theoretical oceanographers
 and ocean modellers). The use of a single density equation will ensure a unified field. </li>
<li> the Absolute Salinity Anomaly takes into account evaporation and dilution. </li>
<li> freezing temperatures</li>
<li> isobaric melting enthalpy and isobaric evaporation enthalpy</li>
</ul>

<p>Main changes</p>
<ul>
<li> all functions which have in-situ temperature t as the input temperature now end in "_t_exact"</li>
<li> all functions which have Conservative Temperature CT as the input temperature and which are directly evaluated using the Gibbs function now end in "_CT_exact" (in version 2 they ended in "_CT")</li>
<li> all functions which have Conservative Temperature CT as the input temperature and were based on the 
25 term density equation have been replaced with the 48 term density function. 
<br/>The "_CT25" ending has been dropped.</li>
<li> the 25 term density equation has been removed.</li>
<li> <b>all functions which have Conservative Temperature CT as the input temperature but use the 48 term 
density function can be called either with "_CT" at the end of their function names or without this ending.</b>
 This point is the biggest change as many of these function names in version 2 used in-situ 
 temperature (t) as the input temperature and the relied on the Gibbs function.</li>
<li> Geostrophic streamfunctions now allow the user to define a reference pressure, and the options 
for the interpolation style and interpolated bottle resolution has been removed.</li>

</ul>
<p>Bug fixes</p>

<h2>Version 2 <font size="3">(18th October 2010)</font></h2>
<p>Consists of approximately 100 functions</p>
<p>Introduced</p>
<ul>
<li> the new naming structure for conversion functions, gsw_X_from_Y</li>
<li> Streamfunctions</li>
<li> water column properties</li>
<li> neutral and non-linear properties</li>
<li> planet Earth properties </li>
<li> derivatives of enthalpy, entropy, Conservative temperature and potential temperature </li>
<li> 25 term density equation (intended for modellers)</li>
</ul>
<p>Major changes</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolute Salinity Anomaly extended to cover all areas of the ocean </li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes</p>


<h2>Version 1 <font size="3">(1st January 2009)</font></h2>
<p>Consists of approximately 16 functions</p>
<p>Introduction of the Absolute Salinity Anomaly</p>
